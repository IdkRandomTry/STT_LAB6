We expect the file output stream to be closed (which is it)// however the FileManager instance is kept in AbstractManager.MAP. This means that// when we create a new rolling file appender with the DirectWriteRolloverStrategy// this OLD file manager will be retrieved from the map (since it has the SAME file pattern)// and this is a problem as the output stream on that file manager is CLOSED. The problem// here is that we attempt to remove a file manager call NULL instead of FILE PATTERN// create a new rolling file appender for this logger. We expect this to create a new file// manager as the old one should have been removed. Since the instance of this file manager// is still in AbstractManager.MAP, it is returned and assigned to our new rolling file// appender instance. The problem here is that the file manager is create with the name// FILE PATTERN and that its output stream is closed.// try and log something. This will not be logged anywhere. An exception will be thrown:// Caused by: java.io.IOException: Stream Closed// remove the appender as before.// this method will use reflection to go and remove the instance of FileManager from the AbstractManager.MAP// ourselves. This means that the rolling file appender has been stopped (previous method) AND its// manager has been removed.// now that the instance of FileManager is not present in MAP, creating the appender will actually// create a new rolling file manager, and put this in the map (keyed on file pattern again).// because we have a new instance of file manager, this will create a new output stream. We can verify// this by looking inside the filepattern.1.log file inside the working directory, and noticing that// we have 'test message 1' followed by 'test message 3'. 'test message 2' is missing because we attempted// to write while the output stream was closed.// possible fixes:// 1) create the RollingFileManager and set it's name to FILE PATTERN when using DirectWriteRolloverStrategy// 2) when stopping the appender (and thus the manager), remove on FILE PATTERN if DirectWriteRolloverStrategy// 3) on OutputStreamManager.getOutputStream(), determine if the output stream is closed, and if it is create//              a new one. Note that this isn't really desirable as the only fix as if the file pattern had to// change//              an instance of file manager would still exist in MAP, causing a resource leak.// now the obvious problem here is that if multiple file appenders use the same rolling file manager. We may run// into a case where the file manager is removed and the output stream is closed, and the remaining appenders// may not work correctly. I'm not sure  of the use case in this scenario, and if people actually do this// but based on the code it would be possible. I have also not tested this scenario out as it is not the// scenario we would ever use, but it should be considered while fixing this issue.// Retrieve the map itself.// Remove the file manager keyed on file pattern.// This call attempts to remove the file manager, but uses the name of the appender// (NULL in this case) instead of PATTERN.// see AbstractManager.stop(...).// All loggers must have a root logger.
